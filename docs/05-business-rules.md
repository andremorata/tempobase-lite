3. Only one running timer is allowed per user.
4. User stops the timer and duration is finalized.

### Manual entry

1. User selects a date and provides a time range or duration.
2. User adds project/task/tag context.
3. The entry is stored as a completed time entry.

### Reporting

1. User selects a date range and filters.
2. The system produces summary, detailed, or weekly views.
3. Reports may be exported or shared when the user has permission.

### CSV import

1. User uploads a supported CSV export.
2. The system validates and maps rows.
3. The user confirms the import.
4. Duplicate rows are skipped according to the active duplicate-detection rules.

## 4. Entity Rules

- Required: `email`, profile name fields, and password hash.
- Email is unique per account and treated case-insensitively.
- A user belongs to exactly one account.
- A user has exactly one active role within the account.
- Deactivated users retain historical data but cannot authenticate.

### Client

- Required: `name` unique within the account.
- Archived clients should remain visible in historical references and reports.

### Project

- Required: `name` unique within the account.
- Project billing defaults may influence new time entries.
- Archived projects are hidden from normal selection but preserved historically.

### Task

- Required: `name` unique within its project.
- Task-level billing settings may override project defaults where supported.

### TimeEntry

- Required: owning user and a valid start context.
- A running entry has no completed end timestamp yet.
- A completed entry must satisfy `end >= start`.
- A single user cannot have more than one running timer.
- A single entry cannot exceed 24 hours.
- Billable state defaults from project/task settings when applicable and may be overridden.

### Tag

- Tag names are unique within an account.
- Tags are many-to-many with time entries.

### AuditLog

- Audit records are immutable.
- Audit visibility is restricted to the roles allowed by the product.

## 6. Invariants

- Cross-account data access is never allowed.
- A user can have at most one running timer.
- Completed entries satisfy `end_time >= start_time`.
- Soft-deleted or archived records remain available for historical views where required.
- Default project preferences must reference a project in the same account.

## 7. Calculation Rules

- Duration is derived from start/end timestamps or validated manual input.
- Decimal duration is a derived reporting value.
- Amount is based on duration multiplied by the active rate source when billing is enabled.
- When a user's `canViewAmounts` is `false`, all monetary values (billed amounts, rates) are stripped server-side from report responses and hidden from the UI. This is enforced at the API layer regardless of client state.
- Rounding, when supported, is applied at presentation or export time unless explicitly persisted.
